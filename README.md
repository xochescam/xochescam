### Hi 👋🏼


I’m Xoch a girl who is passionate about designing and coding tools.

<br>

Lately, I've been working on ReactJS and exploring Framer ✨
<br>
I'm interested in social projects, cause my motivation is about improving lives through software 
<br>
Actually, I teach subjects UX principles to future Software Engineers
